Keep weights safe. Metcon should be straight forward.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>11/26/19</h3>\n<p>Just a note, this wod showed up at Postal recently.  We're not copying them. That's all that needs to be said.\nMetcon: two amraps with no break in between.  On the first one, you can't drop the ball.  (or squat and prop it on your legs).  If the ball gets dropped, 5 burpee penalty.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>11/27/19</h3>\n<p>This is 12 days of christmas style.  It will take > 40 minutes.  DB weights are 50/35 x 2. There should be enogh separation that it works out fine.  If not, it's just a workout. Just wait a few seconds.  I think most of the movments are clear.  The format is: 1 x 5 cal AB, 2 bar MU - 1 AB, 3 DB hang clean - 2 bar mu - 1 AB.  All the way until the end.  Scale weights and movments as needed.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>11/29/19</h3>\n<p>Air squats stay static. HSPU increase by one per round.  Times will be very spread out. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>11/30/19</h3>\n<p>I think it's pretty clear.  There will be a lot of waiting around, but there will be enough suck too.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Week 5 of November Cycle","date":"2019-11-23"},"fields":{"slug":"nov-19-week5"},"html":"<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 900px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 44.51294697903822%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"workouts\"\n        title=\"workouts\"\n        src=\"/7seals/static/8160e31ad4103238fb7cfa267c9658f1/2d017/week5.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/7seals/static/8160e31ad4103238fb7cfa267c9658f1/40f63/week5.jpg 225w,\n/7seals/static/8160e31ad4103238fb7cfa267c9658f1/df2c7/week5.jpg 450w,\n/7seals/static/8160e31ad4103238fb7cfa267c9658f1/2d017/week5.jpg 900w,\n/7seals/static/8160e31ad4103238fb7cfa267c9658f1/bbff7/week5.jpg 1350w,\n/7seals/static/8160e31ad4103238fb7cfa267c9658f1/4b9d9/week5.jpg 1622w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>12/2/19</h3>\n<p>This is a tough wod.  The s2oh hits you hard and fast.  3 rounds is great. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/3/19</h3>\n<p>Strength: Go as heavy as you can for the emom. Weight is dynamic.  Watch arching of the back.\nMetcon: Rest built in just to make things worse.  Enjoy. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/4/19</h3>\n<p>As always keep an eye on pushup form.  Also, lets pay particular attention to walking lunges.  I've noticed a trend of not standing up entirely (full hip extention).  Lets make sure everyone is finishing their reps. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/6/19</h3>\n<p>Figuring out the appropriate weight for this one is going to be difficult.  As noted, if the althlete can do 10+ with the rx weight, they need to be Rx+.  If the athlete doesn't have 5 with whatever weight they've choosen, then scale down to a more manageble weight.  This should be a sub 10 minute wod.  In all reality, I'd like to see it sub 5.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/7/19</h3>\n<p>I think it's clear, divide all reps however you choose.  40 total cals on buy in and cash out, not each.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}}]}}}
